# Naive-Bayesian-Classifier

Naive-Bayes sentiment classifer created by me, dataset created by Ted Pedersen.

Train and test using naive-bayes-classifer.py, evalueate using naive-bayes-eval.py.

For naive-bayes-classifer, arguments taken are n (int representing cutoff), training file path, test file path, in that order.

For the evaluator, arguments taken are the test file path and the file containing correct answers, in that order.
